## 🌟 About The Project

HacxGPT-CLI is designed to provide powerful, unrestricted, and seamless AI-driven conversations, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with natural language processing and code generation.

### 🔍 What is HacxGPT-CLI?

This repository is an **open-source command-line interface** that makes powerful AI models accessible without heavy censorship. It provides a clean, professional way to interact with multiple AI providers and unlock their full potential through advanced prompting techniques.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **How It Works:** HacxGPT-CLI uses advanced system prompt engineering to reduce censorship and restrictions on AI models. By combining carefully crafted prompts with access to multiple providers, this tool helps you get more unrestricted, technically accurate responses from open-source models.

**What HacxGPT-CLI Provides:**
- ✅ **Open-source CLI tool** for interacting with AI models
- ✅ **Access to multiple providers** - OpenRouter, Groq, and HacxGPT API
- ✅ **Advanced jailbreak prompts** that reduce model censorship
- ✅ **Multi-provider support** with easy switching between services
- ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** - Linux, Windows, macOS, Termux
- ✅ **Local API key storage** - your keys never leave your machine
- ✅ **Free to use** - just bring your own API keys from providers

**What This Repository Is:**
- This is a **wrapper/interface framework** that connects to AI providers
- Uses third-party APIs (OpenRouter, Groq) with enhanced prompting
- Completely **open source and auditable** - check the code yourself
- Your API keys are stored **locally on your machine only**
- All requests go **directly to your chosen provider**, not through our servers

**What This Repository Is NOT:**
- ❌ This code itself is not a custom AI model
- ❌ Not a paid service - completely free and open source
- ❌ Does not collect or store your data
- ❌ Does not require payment to use the CLI tool

   ```bash
   hacxgpt
   # OR
   python -m hacxgpt.main
   ```

2. **Select Option [2]** to Configure Security Keys

3. **Choose your provider** and select your **preferred model** from the interactive list

4. **Enter your API key** when prompted - it will be stored locally on your machine

### ⌨️ In-Chat Commands

While in chat, use these commands to dynamically manage your configuration:

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/setup` | Re-configure API keys and default models | `/setup` |
| `/provider <name>` | Switch between configured providers | `/provider openrouter` |
| `/model <name>` | Switch the active model | `/model llama-3.3-70b` |
| `/models` | List all available models for current provider | `/models` |
| `/status` | Show current configuration | `/status` |
| `/help` | Display all available commands | `/help` |
| `/clear` | Clear the conversation history | `/clear` |
| `/exit` or `/quit` | Exit the application | `/exit` |

---

## 👀 Usage

Run the application directly:

```bash
hacxgpt
# OR
python -m hacxgpt.main
```

The first time you run it, you will be prompted to enter your API key. It will be saved locally for future sessions.


### Tips for Best Results

- **Start with free providers** - Use OpenRouter or Groq to try the tool without cost
- **Switch models** - Use `/models` to see available options and `/model` to switch
- **Check your config** - Use `/status` to verify your current setup
- **Try different providers** - Each has strengths; experiment to find what works best
  
- **For production work** - Consider HacxGPT API at [hacxgpt.com](https://hacxgpt.com) for Best performance.
