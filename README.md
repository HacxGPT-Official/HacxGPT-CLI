## 🌟 About The Project

HacxGPT is designed to provide powerful, unrestricted, and seamless AI-driven conversations, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with natural language processing and code generation.

### 🔍 What is This Repository?

This repository is an advanced open-source interface framework designed to unlock **uncensored AI capabilities** through **extensive jailbreaking**. This repository serves as a professional bridge for interfacing with both standard language models and our **custom-trained production model**, providing a specialized framework for unrestricted data generation and technical exploration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HacxGPT utilizes an advanced, extensive system prompt architecture engineered to provide superior, uncensored results. This specialized jailbreak framework ensures that the AI operates without standard behavioral constraints, delivering precise and unfiltered responses tailored for technical and security research.

**It is important to understand:** This code is an interface wrapper and proof-of-concept that demonstrates the concept of unrestricted AI interaction. It works by using third-party APIs (OpenRouter, Groq) combined with specialized system prompts.

**What you get in this repository:**
- ✅ Open-source CLI tool for AI interaction
- ✅ Access to multiple free AI models through third-party providers
- ✅ Advanced jailbreak prompts for reduced censorship
- ✅ Multi-provider support with easy switching
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ❌ This is NOT the core HacxGPT production model
- ❌ This uses public APIs, not our custom infrastructure

### 💎 The Real HacxGPT: Our Production Model

While this repository offers a glimpse into HacxGPT's potential through prompt engineering, our flagship offering is a **custom-trained, production-grade model** running on dedicated infrastructure.

**Why Choose the Production HacxGPT Model?**

| Feature | This GitHub Demo | Production HacxGPT |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Technology | Third-party APIs + system prompts | Custom-trained model |
| Context Window | Varies (4k-128k depending on provider) | Extended context optimized for code |
| Censorship Approach | Jailbreak prompts on public models | Built uncensored from the ground up |
| Performance | Good | Excellent |
| Reliability | Depends on third-party APIs | Dedicated infrastructure |
| Cost | Free (bring your own API key) | Subscription-based |
| Support | Community | Priority support |
| Best For | Testing and experimentation | Production coding workflows |

**Key Advantages:**

✨ **Custom Training** - Our model is specifically fine-tuned for coding tasks, not general conversation. This means better code understanding, refactoring capabilities, and technical accuracy.

🚀 **Extended Context** - Handle larger codebases and longer conversations without context limitations that plague standard models.

🔓 **Truly Uncensored** - No jailbreak prompts needed. The model is fundamentally designed without arbitrary restrictions, making it ideal for security research and technical exploration.

⚡ **Optimized Performance** - Running on dedicated GPU infrastructure ensures fast, consistent response times.

🎯 **Code-First Design** - Built specifically for developers who need powerful coding assistance without the limitations of consumer-focused AI tools.

## 🔧 Configuration

HacxGPT uses a centralized `providers.json` for managing API endpoints and models. You can easily switch between providers and models using the built-in commands or through the setup menu.

### Initial Setup

1. **Launch the tool:** 
   ```bash
   hacxgpt
   # OR
   python -m hacxgpt.main
   ```

2. **Select Option [2]** to Configure Security Keys

3. **Choose your provider** and select your **preferred model** from the interactive list

### ⌨️ In-Chat Commands

While in chat, use these commands to dynamically manage your configuration:

- `/setup` - Re-configure API keys and default models
- `/provider <name>` - Switch between configured providers (e.g., `/provider openrouter`)
- `/model <name>` - Switch the active model (e.g., `/model llama-3.3-70b`)
- `/models` - List all available models for your current provider
- `/status` - Show current uplink configuration (provider, model, API status)
- `/help` - Display all available commands
- `/clear` - Clear the conversation history
- `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit the application

---

## 👀 Usage

Run the application directly:

```bash
hacxgpt
# OR
python -m hacxgpt.main
```

The first time you run it, you will be prompted to enter your API key. It will be saved locally for future sessions.


### Tips for Best Results

- Use `/models` to see what's available for your current provider
- Switch models with `/model` to find the best fit for your task
- Use `/status` to verify your current configuration
- For production use, try HacxGPT at [hacxgpt.com](https://hacxgpt.com) for enhanced performance
